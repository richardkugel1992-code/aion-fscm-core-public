# AION FSCM - System Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary
AION FSCM (Fusion Stability Control Middleware) is a high-performance, deterministic infrastructure framework. It is engineered to bridge the gap between volatile, high-dimensional input streams and stable, high-fidelity operational output. The architecture follows a strictly decoupled design pattern to ensure system integrity, modularity, and IP protection.

Core Components
​1. Gateway API Layer
​The entry point for all incoming data vectors. It performs initial schema validation and sanitization, ensuring no malformed data reaches the stabilization core.
​2. Stability Guardrail (Infrastructure Layer)
​This layer acts as the primary safety mechanism. It utilizes Lipschitz-filtering and Brouwer-Fixed-Point mapping to detect and clamp signal drift. If the incoming data exceeds stability parameters, the guardrail triggers an automated reversion to the anchor state (\vec{x}_{root}).
​3. Proprietary Kernel (Fusion Engine)
​The system's core. This module is intentionally decoupled from the open-source infrastructure. It interfaces with the infrastructure via high-performance, strictly typed API hooks.
​Isolation: The kernel operates within a sandboxed execution environment.
​Stability Guarantee: Ensures deterministic convergence regardless of hardware architecture (ARM64/x86_64).
​IP Protection: The kernel logic is injected via isolated modules, preventing infrastructure-level exposure.
​4. Evidence & Validation (Proof of Performance)
​System integrity is documented within the docs/evidence/ directory. These logs demonstrate:
​Convergence Proof: Real-time neutralization of signal anomalies.
​Latency Neutrality: Sub-millisecond execution time, proving the framework does not introduce bottleneck overhead during process stabilization.
​Security & Integrity Policy
​The architecture follows a "Least Privilege" security model.
​Data Isolation: All process control data is handled in-memory; no persistent storage of operational vectors is performed by the infrastructure layer.
​Hardware Agnostic: Stability parity is maintained across heterogeneous mobile platforms (Tensor/Exynos), demonstrating the robustness of the underlying architectural design.
